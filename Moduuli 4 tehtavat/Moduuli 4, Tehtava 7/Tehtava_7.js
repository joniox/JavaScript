// Advanced. Routing with digitransit (16p)
// Not for the faint-hearted. Don't do this if it interferes with the project.
// It's not worth it.
// Create an app that shows the route from user defined address to school (Karaportti 2).
// You need to have a form where user adds an address. After the form is
// submitted, the route is displayed on a map. Show also the starting and
// ending time of the trip. Not each part, just the start and end times.
// Example: JS, HTML
// You'll need this Leaflet plugin to make the example work.
// Here is an example on how to use places/addresses with coordinates.
// To get coordinates from address, you can use address search
// If you get cors errors (which is likely not going to happen) use this fix.
