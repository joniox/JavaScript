// Write a function called even(), which receives an array containing
// numbers as a parameter. The function returns a second (usually smaller)
// array which has the even numbers of the original array.
// The function must not make changes to the original table. (3p)
//
// Example: In a three-item array, there are items 2, 7 and 4.
// The function returns a two-item array with items 2 and 4.
//
// Print both the original array and the new array to the console
// in the main program after you have called the function.
//
// You can hard code the array, no need for prompt().

let numbers = [2, 7, 4];

function even() {
  let evenNumbers = numbers.filter(number => number % 2 === 0);
  return evenNumbers;
}

console.log(numbers);
console.log(even());
